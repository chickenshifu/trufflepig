Python based script to find gems on coinmarketcap


This script opens coinmarketcap.com and parses <all> currently listed Cryptocurrency projects. The program persits all entries in a simple SQLite database.

After it has been parsed all cryptos to see whether new projects were added, it enfolds its magic ;) 

Shall the magic reveals only to the believers!
